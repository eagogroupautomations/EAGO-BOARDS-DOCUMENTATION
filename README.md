### EAGO EVALUATION BOARD ###
Edited by Benson Muchemi
#### Description ###
The Eago development board contains a series of Microcontroller boards compatible with STM32Cube IDE and Arduino IDE.
Also contains ESP microcontroller(ESP8285) that are on-board and compatible with arduino with pinout extension and enables wifi connectivity.
Eago V1 kits and boards ship with an STM32F103 Chip packaged in a manner that is both beginner friendly and also feature-packed for intermediate hobbyists.
The Eago V1 board has its shield compatible with the board.
At the core is 72MHz ARM Cortex M3 with 64Kb of flash memory. The board ships with an inbuilt USB to Serial interface(cp2102) making it easy to program and SWD interface for easy debugging.

     ## Eago group,Eago Developers’ Kit and Developers’ Board ##
The Eago Developer Boards and Kits aim to provide an easy path for IoT newbies and hobbyists to get started with easy tests for hardware development , firmware development , training and data publishing and subscription using GPRS and wifi chip on board.

   ### Getting Started ###
The Eago Developer Board and Kit can be programmed using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) ,[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) or [SMT32Cube](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).
Select a preferred development environment and configure your setup as detailed below.

   ### Arduino IDE ###
Download and install Arduino IDE for your preferred platform by selecting an installable package from the [Arduino Software Downloads page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
Learn more about setting up Arduino Cores by following the Arduino Guide [Arduino Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/cores).

 __Setting up STM32Duino Core (recommended)__.
1. On Windows and Linux-based OS’es, to setup STM32Duino Core, launch the Arduino IDE and navigate to File > Preferences options on the Arduino IDE menu bar.
2. In the Preferences window, paste the link https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/main/package_stmicroelectronics_index.json inside the Additional Boards Manager URLs input box and save it by clicking OK.
On MacOS,the Preferences menu can be accessed by clicking on _Arduino > Preferences_ from the App menu.
3. Under the _Tools_ option in the menu bar, Select Board and on the resulting palette window select _Boards Manager...._
   For full instructions on using the "Boards Manager", see the [Getting Started page](https://github.com/stm32duino/wiki/wiki/Getting-Started).
4. On the _Boards Manager options_, set filter to _Contributed_ and type _STM32 Cores_ in the search box. Then click on _Install_ .
       If you run into any issues consult the[documentation](https://github.com/stm32duino/wiki/wiki/Getting-Started)..

__PlatformIO__
1. Install PlatformIO as detailed in the [installation options page](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#installation-methods).
2. Install STM32 platform support by running the following command from your terminal.

    `pio platform install stm32`
__STM32Cube IDE__

1. Download and install STM32Cube IDE for your OS and platform of choice by selecting an installable package from the [downloads page](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).
2. Create a new project by selecting the  _File > New > STM32 Project_  options in the menu bar.
3. Under the _MCU/MPU Selector tab_, type F103C8 under the Part Number input box.
4. On the accompanying container window on the right, select STM32F103C8.
5. Proceed to configure the MCU as needed by clicking _Next >_ at the bottom of the pane.

     ## Building and Uploading Code to Eago Dev Board/Dev Kit ##
     
     ### Using STM32CubeProgrammer (Arduino/PIO) ###
1. Download and install [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) for your OS of choice.
2. Using Arduino IDE, under the Tools option in the menu bar, select Board > STM32 Board`s > Generic STM32F1 series then under Board part number select Generic F103C8 if you’re using STM32Duino.
3. Under the same Tools menu, ensure that you have set the Upload method to STM32CubeProgrammer(Serial).
Set the appropriate port to upload.

   ### Using STM32Flash ###
1. Install [STM32Flash](https://sourceforge.net/p/stm32flash/wiki/Home/) for your OS of choice.
2. Ensure that the location of the STM32Flash executable is available in your path variables.
3. The arguments provided to the stm32flash utility are as follows:

        stm32flash -b [int] -v -w [path] [port]
        stm32flash -b [int] -v -w [path] [port]
        -b : baud rate > Should be 115200
        -v : verify write
        -w : write > requires path to binary file
        port : serial port where device is connected to  
 
 Learn more under usage[usage](https://sourceforge.net/p/stm32flash/wiki/Home/)
 
   ## STM32Cube IDE ##
   
1. Build the binary (ensure that you have configured this properly by right-clicking on your project _Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > MCU Post build outputs and select Convert to binary file (-O binary))_ .
     * The command to upload the binary is
 
           stm32flash -b 115200 -v -w <path-to-build-output-file>.bin  <port-example-COM4-or-/dev/cu.usbserial-AAAA733T>
           
    ## PlatformIO ##
    
* You can use STM32Flash for PlatformIO as well. See example below
    * First build the binary
    
             pio run

* Then upload to target board

      stm32flash -b 115200 -v -w .pio/build/genericSTM32F103C8/firmware.bin  /dev/cu.usbserial-AAAA733T

* For PlatformIO you can also build and upload the binary by executing the following command in your terminal
* Build and upload (ensure that you have configured the port in platformio.ini)

      pio run --target=upload
