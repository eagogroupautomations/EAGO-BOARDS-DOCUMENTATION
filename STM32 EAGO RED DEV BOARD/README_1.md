  * ExternalI2C EEPROM 64KB connected to STM32.
  * SIM800C.
 All of the modules can work together or each separately. 
 Each module has its own pinout headers.
 
The convenient solution for the development of new projects requiring larger memory space and WiFi for IOT.

Via USB you can update sketches and firmware for STM32F103C8T6 and for ESP8285. This on board has the USB-serial converter CP2102.

Using this board is very simple.

The board has a DIP-switch, to connect the modules.

For example, to USB and stm32f10c8t6, USB and ESP8285, and USB to external Serial.
